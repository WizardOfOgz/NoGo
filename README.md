### NoGo is a library to find the places in your code which touch your database
Nogo's main objective is to help find and prevent code which accesses the database during testing.

## Installation
Add nogo to your Gemfile

```gem 'nogo'```

Or install from the command line

```gem install nogo```

## Usage

Currently RSpec 2 is the only test framework which is supported.

### RSpec
Wrap any spec examples that should not use the database adapter inside a "nogo do" block.

<pre>
# In your specs
require 'nogo/rspec' # Automatically connects, so this should be included after the environment is loaded.

describe Klass do
  it 'works without error' do
    Klass.create
  end

  nogo do # Any access to the database inside this block will raise an exception
    it 'raises error' do
      expect{ Klass.create }.to raise_error
    end
  end

  it 'works without error' do
    Klass.create
  end
end
</pre>

### Globally enabling NoGo
By default NoGo will not check requests to the database, even after being connected.  Here is an example of enabling NoGo.

<pre>
require 'nogo'

# Database adapter should already be connected
NoGo::Connection.connect!

ModelKlass.create                   # Works as expected

NoGo::Connection.enabled = true
ModelKlass.create                   # Raises exception

NoGo::Connection.enabled = false
ModelKlass.create                   # Works as expected
</pre>
